# ILP

General Information
-------------------
ILP is a migration plan creator for deduplicated storage systems.

Running
-------
1. install and configure gurobi and boost

2. Complie the code
   > ./compile_Thanos-united.sh

3. Run ILP
   > ./Thanos-United {volumeList} {summaryFile} { Traffic } {margin} {innerFilter} {outDir} {timeLimit} {seed} {num of threads}
		
    1)	Volumelist: volume List section
    2)	summaryFile: path to the summary file.
    3)	Traffic: what is the maximum amount of traffic allowed for the algorithm (0-100, representing percentage)
    4)	Margin: the error margin allowed from the desired balance. If this margin is 1 or more, the code would run without load balancing. (0-1, representing fraction)
    5)	innerFilter: a huge relaxation of the load balancing constraint. It is recommended to be left at 0 unless significant time improvements are needed (with accuracy reduction being accepted)
    6)	outDir: a directory where the output files would be stored
    7)	timeLimit: how many seconds is the gurobi solver allowed to run
    8)	seed: the random seed given to the gurobi runner, different models can find better/faster solutions under different seeds
    9)	num of threads: how many threads could gurobi use. Recommended to use just a bit bellow the server’s maximum amount of CPU’s

Examples
------------------
Find a migration plan for examples/basicLoadBalance_k1_3Vols, saving the summary in summary.csv, the migration plan cannot use more than 20% of the original size as traffic and must be within margin of 0.25 from the desired load balance. use all blocks without inner filter, random seed of 10 and 10 threads, saving the output into the outDir folder:
   > ./Thanos-United examples/basicLoadBalance_k1_3Vols summary.csv 20 0.25 0 outDir/ 21600 10 10
